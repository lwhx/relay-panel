## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-25

First public release of RelayPanel.

### Highlights

- **TCP/UDP forwarding panel** with relay-node architecture, WebSocket
  real-time config push, and HTTP polling fallback.
- **Multi-plan registration.** Administrators configure which plans are
  available for registration; users pick a plan when signing up.
- **Per-target circuit breaker.** 3 consecutive connect failures → 30-second
  circuit break; all-down fails open (probe mode). Applies to failover and
  round-robin strategies over TCP/WS/TLS.
- **User rule management.** Administrators manage a user's rules directly from
  the user management page; ownership determined by entry point.
- **GeoIP node region display** with built-in primary (ipinfo.io) and fallback
  (ipwho.is) sources. GeoIP cache auto-cleaned on node deletion.
- **SQLite + PostgreSQL dual backend** with compile-time trait enforcement and
  CI-guarded test parity.
- **Dashboard** with node aggregation, traffic statistics, and quota management.
