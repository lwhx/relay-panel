## [1.0.3] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Node-side traffic counter poison-pill.** When a rule was deleted, stale
  bytes in the node's `TrafficCounter` were never pruned. The next report batch
  was rejected atomically, the node kept retrying the same bytes, and traffic
  billing froze until node restart. The counter entry is now pruned when its
  rule disappears from the config and no live listener still references it.
- **Per-rule export button had no label.** The icon-only export button in the
  rules action column now shows 导出 / Export, matching its siblings.

### Changed

- **New 石墨靛蓝 / Graphite + Indigo UI theme.** Graphite sidebar, indigo accent,
  larger radii, hairline borders, flatter buttons — replacing the default
  deep-blue admin-template look. antd v6 token-driven; no business components
  touched.
- **Self-hosted Noto Sans SC (思源黑体)** as the UI font, for crisp and
  consistent CJK rendering across platforms.
- **Forced password-change notice reworded** (zh + en) to cover both the
  admin-reset and create-with-must-change cases, instead of only "an admin
  reset your password".

## [1.0.2] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **PostgreSQL: creating a forward rule failed with `database error`.** The
  owner-scope ownership guard in `replace_rule_targets` decoded a `SELECT 1`
  literal as `i64`. PostgreSQL types integer literals as `INT4`, so sqlx
  rejected the `INT8`/`INT4` mismatch. SQLite's dynamic typing masked the bug,
  so it only affected PostgreSQL deployments. Now decoded as `i32`.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-25

First public release of RelayPanel.

### Highlights

- **TCP/UDP forwarding panel** with relay-node architecture, WebSocket
  real-time config push, and HTTP polling fallback.
- **Multi-plan registration.** Administrators configure which plans are
  available for registration; users pick a plan when signing up.
- **Per-target circuit breaker.** 3 consecutive connect failures → 30-second
  circuit break; all-down fails open (probe mode). Applies to failover and
  round-robin strategies over TCP/WS/TLS.
- **User rule management.** Administrators manage a user's rules directly from
  the user management page; ownership determined by entry point.
- **GeoIP node region display** with built-in primary (ipinfo.io) and fallback
  (ipwho.is) sources. GeoIP cache auto-cleaned on node deletion.
- **SQLite + PostgreSQL dual backend** with compile-time trait enforcement and
  CI-guarded test parity.
- **Dashboard** with node aggregation, traffic statistics, and quota management.
