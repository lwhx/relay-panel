// v0.4.3: Repository trait layer.
//
// Domain-specific traits (UserRepository, RuleRepository, ...) define the data
// access contract. The aggregate `Repository` trait combines them so handlers
// take a single `Arc<dyn Repository>` dependency.
//
// PR1: only SqliteRepository implements these traits. PR2 will add
// PgRepository (PostgreSQL) implementing the same traits.
//
// Design principles:
//   - Methods return domain models (User, ForwardRule, ...) — no DB types leak.
//   - Transactions are encapsulated inside methods (e.g. apply_traffic_batch,
//     reset_traffic) — no `begin()` / `Tx` leaks to handlers.
//   - Errors are DbError (unified codes), not raw sqlx::Error.
//   - Service-layer logic (config assembly, protocol derivation, stale sweep)
//     stays in the caller, NOT in the repository.
//
// dead_code: some trait methods in this module are part of the contract but
// not yet wired to a handler in PR1 (e.g. increment_user_traffic,
// delete_rules_by_uid). They're reachable through the trait object and will be
// used by future callers / PgRepository parity tests; silence the lints rather
// than delete the contract.
