/// Bump this ONLY when the wire format of `ListenerConfig` /
/// `NodeConfigResponse` / `StatusReport` breaks in a way old nodes can't
/// deserialize. Within the same value, panel and node releases are
/// interoperable even if the product version differs.
///
/// v1 = the v0.4.0 split: `ListenerConfig.entry_transport` renamed to
/// `node_transport` (type `NodeTransport`), new `protocol`/`route_mode` fields,
/// `PublicTransport`/`NodeTransport` enums replace `EntryTransport`.
/// v2 = the v0.4.1 TlsSimple semantics change: a v0.4.0 node receiving a
/// `TlsSimple` listener silently skips it (no rustls integration), while a
/// v0.4.1 node actually runs a TLS listener. The gate forces panel/node to
/// upgrade in lockstep so a v0.4.0 node can't silently fail to forward a
/// tls_simple rule. (WSS variant removal is NOT the reason — Wss lives in the
/// admin API enum, not in ListenerConfig.)
/// v3 = v0.4.6 multi-target load balancing: `ListenerConfig` gains
/// `load_balance_strategy`. Old nodes ignore the strategy and would silently
/// run their implicit ordered-failover behavior, so the gate forces panel/node
/// to upgrade together when a rule relies on round-robin / failover semantics.
/// v4 = v0.4.7: removed the dead `speed_limit` / `ip_limit` / `route_mode`
/// wire fields from ListenerConfig. A v0.4.6 node still expects those fields,
/// so deserialization would fail or misread — the gate forces a coordinated
/// upgrade. Also adds node_transport to the listener fingerprint.

// === v0.4.8: Rule diagnosis ===  === v0.4.9: secure-diagnose challenge + TCP-only ===
//
// Flow: panel sends `DiagnoseRuleMessage` to a node over WS (group-scoped);
// the node runs side-channel TCP reachability probes (NOT through the
// forwarder, so they don't count against rule traffic or rate limits) and
// POSTs a `DiagnoseResult` back over the existing HTTP node→panel channel.
// The panel correlates by request_id + node_id.
//
// v0.4.9 — diagnosis is now TCP-ONLY:
//   - Only TCP reachability is probed. The old UDP "route-only" check
//     (`TargetProbeOutcome::RouteOnly`) is gone — UDP can't be verified
//     cheaply, and a "resolved but not probed" result misled operators.
//   - A pure-UDP rule is rejected by the panel (`POST .../diagnose` → 400
//     "UDP 暂不支持诊断") before any probe is sent. The node never receives
//     such a rule.
//   - A tcp_udp rule is probed on its TCP listener ONLY. The node explicitly
//     selects the TCP listener for the rule (it does NOT rely on HashMap
//     iteration order, which would be nondeterministic for a tcp_udp rule
//     that runs two listeners).
//
// Versioning (v0.4.9 hardened the protocol):
//   - The diagnose FEATURE first shipped in v0.4.8, but v0.4.8 nodes do NOT
//     speak the secure challenge protocol: they ignore the `challenge` field
//     on the way in and omit it on the way back. To keep them from silently
//     bypassing the challenge check, the panel only dispatches to nodes that
//     support the SECURE protocol, i.e. >= 0.4.9 (see node_supports_secure_diagnose).
//     A v0.4.8 node is surfaced as "诊断协议过旧，请升级" — it is NOT treated
//     as a "no diagnose at all" node, because the feature does exist on it.
//   - pre-0.4.8 nodes never understood diagnose_rule at all and just ignore
//     the WS message; they also fall under the same unsupported branch.
//   - CONFIG_PROTOCOL_VERSION is intentionally NOT bumped: diagnose is an
//     on-demand probe carried on the WS control channel, not part of the
//     ListenerConfig wire format. Normal forwarding is unaffected for any
//     version. The `challenge` field uses #[serde(default)] both ways so old
//     builds still deserialize each other's messages.
//
// Challenge: the panel generates a random per-run challenge; the node MUST
// echo it back verbatim in DiagnoseResult.challenge. The panel rejects any
// result whose challenge is empty or doesn't byte-for-byte match — this
// defeats a forged result that guesses request_id + node_id without having
// received the probe.
